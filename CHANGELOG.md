## [Unreleased] - 2024-05-30

### Added

### Changed
* Improved Gaussian random number generation from ThreadLocalRandom in methods of RandomVariates class (internal change).
* Improved Gaussian random number generation in static methods of RandomVariates to choose between internal implementation of original ziggurat algorithm (for Java legacy random number generators Random and SecureRandom) or the Java API implementation of the modified ziggurat for all others (internal change).
* Improved Gaussian random number generation in EnhancedRandomGenerator class by replacing our implementation of ziggurat algorithm with delegation to RandomGenerator.nextGaussian method, which for most RandomGenerators is now the modified ziggurat, which is faster than the original version (internal change).

### Deprecated

### Removed

### Fixed
* Added missing overrides in EnhancedSplittableRandom of the rngs and erngs methods.
* Added missing overrides in EnhancedJumpableRandom of the rngs and erngs methods.

### Added
* IndexPair record class for use in methods generating pairs of random indexes.
* IndexTriple record class for use in methods generating triples of random indexes.

  * Versions of nextIntTriple using the new IndexTriple class
  * Versions of nextWindowedIntPair using the new IndexPair class
  * Versions of nextWindowedIntTriple using the new IndexTriple class

  * Streams of random pairs of distinct integers (method pairs)
  * Streams of random pairs of distinct sorted integers (method sortedPairs)
  * Streams of random pairs of distinct integers, separated by at most a specified window (method windowedPairs)
