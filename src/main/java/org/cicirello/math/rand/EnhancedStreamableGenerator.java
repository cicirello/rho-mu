/**
 * An EnhancedStreamableGenerator is used to wrap an object of any class that implements {@link
 * RandomGenerator.StreamableGenerator} for the purpose of adding all of the functionality of the
 * {@link RandomIndexer} and {@link RandomVariates}. See the superclass {@link
 * EnhancedRandomGenerator} for documentation of the enhanced functionality that is added to the
 * wrapped object.
 *
 * <p>The methods of the {@link RandomGenerator.StreamableGenerator} interface, such as {@link
 * #rngs}, that return streams of RandomGenerator are implemented to return streams of
 * EnhancedRandomGenerator objects that wrap the RandomGenerator objects in the streams returned by
 * the enclosed StreamableGenerator. However, additionally this class provides a counterpart, such
 * as {@link #erngs}, for each of these whose return type is explicitly a stream of
 * EnhancedRandomGenerator objects to simplify usage without the need to cast the objects of the
 * stream in order to utilize the enhancements.
